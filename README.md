# Solar System Explorer

An interactive Python application to explore and learn about the planets in our Solar System. This tool provides in-depth astronomical data for each planet, coupled with a 3D visualization powered by NASA's Eyes on the Solar System platform.

## Features

- **Detailed Planetary Data**: Explore comprehensive information on each planet, including:
  - Physical characteristics (mass, diameter, gravity)
  - Orbital properties (rotation period, orbital period)
  - Atmospheric composition
  - Surface features
  - Interesting facts and trivia

- **Interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Richly formatted interface for easy navigation and exploration.

- **3D Visualization**: Integration with NASA’s Eyes on the Solar System for immersive 3D exploration of the planets.

## Installation

To get started with the Solar System Explorer, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-system-explorer.git
cd solar-system-explorer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```

## Usage

### Running the Application

Start the interactive application with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Interactive Exploration

Once the application is running, you can:

1. **Select a planet**: Choose from a list of planets in our Solar System.
2. **View Detailed Information**: Get information about the selected planet’s physical, orbital, and atmospheric characteristics.
3. **Explore the 3D Model**: Launch NASA's 3D viewer to explore the planet interactively.

## Data Sources
